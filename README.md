# good-reminders

The premise is this: Over the course of our days, weeks, and months, we get exposed to so much insightful information. The impulse for peole like me (and maybe you as well) is to record this information, whether it's through written or digital notes, pictures, etc. 

The issue with that is these notes are often "write once, read never" - what good is that insight if it's locked away in notes that will never read?

`good-reminders` gives you a way to regularly re-expose yourself to that information you'd like to keep top of mind. It isn't backed by a scientifically elaborate spaced repetition mechasism, but rather a simple randomization algorithm. 

The idea is that you never know what information might help you unlock a solution to a problem or motivate you to stay the course. By having the app displayed in a place that's readily available and allows for easy visual access, you can conveniently be reminded of the nuggets of wisdom you've encountered throughout your life!
